Following Tutorials to Create and RPG system.  Mostly hacking features from each tutorial that I like into the one as best I can as a non-programmer type.  This is a learning project.

The goal of the project is to create a system that has plenty of custom editors (or at least non-code/limited code based) as a means to edit the game by young people.  The project is intended to be a platform for users to get introduced to Unity and game design.  Users should be able to create and add assets, levels, items, npcs, quests, scripted levels, even mechanics (as best as possible) etc to the game to create a truly unique custom experience with very little coding required.
